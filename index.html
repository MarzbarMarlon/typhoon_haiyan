            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Typhoon Haiyan originated from a disturbance in the Western Pacific Ocean. As it moved westward, favorable atmospheric conditions, including
                warm sea surface temperatures, fueled its rapid intensification. The typhoon made landfall in the Philippines, particularly impacting regions
                with a high population density and vulnerability to storm surges. The geographical characteristics of the affected areas, coupled with the
                unprecedented strength of the typhoon, contributed to the extensive devastation witnessed during its passage.
